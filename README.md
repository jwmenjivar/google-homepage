So this is the first Project that I'm going to build as part of the Odin's Curriculum.

As far as understand, I'am going to be using what I learned during the the last two weeks, about html and css.

I'm also practicing some git repo creation at github.com, and also the clone part.

I'm not sure how to use the change commits  and all of that yet. But I hope it will become second nature as I go by.

Thanks for reading, and hope to give my best at every step. 

It's all about practice.
(I'm happy because I used the nano terminal app to write the things above)
